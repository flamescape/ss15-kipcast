                    <p>If you've ever tried to choose a game with a group of friends on Steam, then you may be able to relate to our frustration. It usually goes something like this:</p>
                    <div class="dialog">
                        <p><span class="john">John:</span>Let's all play a game together!</p>
                        <p><span class="björn">Björn:</span>Okay, how about Space Engineers?</p>
                        <p><span class="gareth">Gareth:</span>I don't have that game. Let's play Terraria instead.</p>
                        <p><span class="john">John:</span>I'm waiting for that to go on sale before I buy it.</p>
                        <p><span class="björn">Björn:</span>So what multiplayer games do we all own then?</p>
                        <p><span class="gareth">Gareth:</span>I don't know, I wish Steam had the ability to tell us!</p>

                    <p>Alleviate your troubles with Friendly Games. Our app allows you to enter a Steam profile and select a set of your friends so that you can instantly determine which multiplayer games you have in common with them.</p>
                    <p>To begin, enter a Steam profile into the input box at the top (url, profile name, or id64 are all acceptable). Don't have one? Try using "<a href="/#/id/76561197961558956">mikuso</a>" as a demo!</p>
                    <p>Once loaded, you can click on individual friends (try more than one!) to compare their games against yours. The games you have in common will be sorted into to categories: "multiplayer" and "singleplayer only". Chat with your friends over Steam and decide which game you'd like to play, then click on the winner to begin playing.</p>
