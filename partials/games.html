            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>If you've ever tried to choose a game with a group of friends on Steam, then you may be able to relate to our frustration. It usually goes something like this:</p>
            <div class="dialog">
                <p><span class="john">John:</span>Let's all play a game together!</p>
                <p><span class="björn">Björn:</span>Okay, how about Space Engineers?</p>
                <p><span class="gareth">Gareth:</span>I don't have that game. Let's play Terraria instead.</p>
                <p><span class="john">John:</span>I'm waiting for that to go on sale before I buy it.</p>
                <p><span class="björn">Björn:</span>So what multiplayer games do we all own then?</p>
                <p><span class="gareth">Gareth:</span>I don't know, I wish Steam had the ability to tell us!</p>

                    <tr><td>Sat. 00:56:03</td><td>Gareth is heavily distracted by Wikipedia. Currently reading about the Queen of England's title and honorary degrees. Not sure how this will contribute to our static web app.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Sat. 01:01:34</td><td>Gareth is now distracted by http://hackertyper.net. Not sure if he thinks this counts as productive behavior.</td></tr>

                    <tr><td>Sat. 01:52:57</td><td>Gareth suggests we all play Curve Fever instead of do productive work.</td></tr>

                    <tr><td>Sat. 03:47:12</td><td>Josh starts to criticise our work. Gareth just barely refrains from getting in his car and driving over to pay Josh a visit.</td></tr>

                    <tr><td>Sat. 11:23:19</td><td>Björn entertains Gareth with soundclips of his sister singing "Do you want to build a snowman?". She missed a line. John is sleeping.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Sat. 11:52:07</td><td>John wakes up and checks the commit log. He is puzzled that the only updated file is this very one. Surely the Europeans must have loads of uncommitted code then, after all they are 5/6 hours ahead.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Sat. 12:33:45</td><td>It is snowing at John and Björns house. John makes a great joke: "What is this, Static Showdown or Static _SNOWDOWN_??". High fives were exchanged. Gareth was sour that it was not snowing at his house.</td></tr>
