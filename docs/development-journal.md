We have initiated our wonderful static web application. Our prospects are looking great.

### 00:18:42
Björn has already begun playing games on his own instead of programming. Typical Björn.

Gareth is heavily distracted by Wikipedia. Currently reading about the Queen of England's title and honorary degrees. Not sure how this will contribute to our static web app.

Gareth is now distracted by http://hackertyper.net. Not sure if he thinks this counts as productive behavior.

Björn wants to go to bed after less than two hours of hackathoning.

### 01:16:55

Björn wakes up and is disappointed by the fact that everyone else is asleep.
